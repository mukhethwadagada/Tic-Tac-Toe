# Tic-Tac-Toe
Certainly! A README.md file is essential for any project, especially for one you might share or revisit later. It explains what your project is, how to use it, and what features it has.

Here's a README.md for your Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game, incorporating all the features you've built:

Features
Two Game Modes: Play against another human player or test your skills against a simple computer AI.

Dynamic Scoreboard: Keeps track of wins for Player X, Player O (or Computer), and draws across multiple rounds.

Customizable Player Names: In Player vs. Player mode, personalize the names for Player X and Player O.

Interactive UI: Responsive design with modern styling, including:

Smooth fade-in animations for the game container.

"Pop-in" animations for 'X' and 'O' marks.

Hover effects on game cells and buttons.

Pill-shaped buttons for mode selection and game reset.

Clear Status Messages: Real-time updates on whose turn it is, game results (win/draw), and player names.

Simple AI: The computer opponent (Player O) employs basic strategies to try and win or block your moves.

How to Play
Download: Clone this repository or download the index.html file.

Open: Open the index.html file directly in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).

Installation
This project is a single-file HTML application. No complex installation or build process is required.

Create a new file named index.html.

Copy and paste the entire code provided into this index.html file.

Save the file.

That's it! You're ready to play.

Game Modes
Upon loading the game, you'll see two mode selection buttons:

Player vs Player (Default)
Click the "Player vs Player" button if it's not already active.

You'll see input fields for "Player X Name" and "Player O Name". Enter your desired names here, or leave them as default.

Players take turns clicking on the cells to place their 'X' or 'O' marks.

Player vs Computer
Click the "Player vs Computer" button.

The name input fields will disappear, and Player O will be automatically set to "Computer".

You (Player X) will make your move, and then the computer (Player O) will automatically make its move after a short delay.

Resetting the Game
The "Reset Game" button will clear the board and start a new round, keeping the current scores intact.

Changing game modes (e.g., from PvP to PvC) will reset the scores to zero to start a fresh competition.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure and content of the game.

CSS3: For all the styling, layout (using CSS Grid), animations, and responsive design.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all game logic, turn management, win condition checks, AI implementation, score tracking, and DOM manipulation.

Future Enhancements
Improved AI: Implement a more advanced AI algorithm (e.g., Minimax) for a more challenging opponent.

Game History: Option to view previous game states or replay rounds.

Sound Effects: Add subtle sounds for moves, wins, and draws.

Difficulty Levels: For the AI opponent.

Confetti/Win Animation: More visual fanfare for wins.

Persistent Scores: Save scores using localStorage so they persist even after closing the browser.
